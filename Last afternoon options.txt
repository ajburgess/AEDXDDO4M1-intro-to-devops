[Evaluation form]

- Finish now
- Carry on with Heroku stuff
- Have lunch, then come back and carry on with Heroku stuff
- More Jenkins stuff (can switch EC2 instances back on if needed)
- Work independently (heroku, reflection task, apply planning, profile, etc)
- Re-join webex later on if any questions etc...

I'll keep webex open all afternoon and am available to support in any way...
